1.For if-statement
a)always use else to avoid uncntroled situations (you can kill function in this else)
b)never nest if-statement more than 2 deep (use function or rethink)

2.For loops
a)in python use while loop only to loop forever
b)for loop for any other kinds of looping

3.Debugging
a) russian debugging > using debugger
b) chcecking if part of code is working as expected after writting it
